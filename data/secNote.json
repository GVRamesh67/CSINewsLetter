The idea was well appreciated by the members present. Shri G V Ramesh, DGM (IT), VSP readily agreed to take the responsibility of editing it and Prof P Jagannadha Varma, Asst. Prof, Lendi Engg College volunteered to provide all necessary support. And the outcome is in front of you. I congratulate Shri Ramesh and his team for all the hard work in germinating an idea into a blooming reality. I thank all the contributors for making this newsletter interesting. I am also thankful to Shri R Nagarajan, ED (Services), VSP & Vice-Chairman CSI, Visakhatpanam, Prof P S Avadhani, Principal, AU College of Engg  and Shri KVSS Rajeswara Rao, GM (IT&ERP) for their support and valuable inputs. Initially the eNewsletter will be published online quarterly. Depending on the response from the members, it can be more frequent."
