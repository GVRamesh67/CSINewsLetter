    "text": "Prime Numbers have become very important in designing security systems, especially after the three scientists Rivest, Shamir & Adleman have devised the famous RSA Algorithm. We all know that a natural number P > 1 is said to be a prime number if it has no divisors other than 1 and P itself. For example, 2,3,5 are all prime numbers. Here, 11 is a prime number with both the digits being equal. Now, the question is what is the next prime number (greater than 11) having all its digits being equal. Justify your answer!"
