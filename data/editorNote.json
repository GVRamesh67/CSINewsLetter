        "line": "It's been a while since we last had a Newsletter. Though, there is no need to emphasise the importance of communication via a newsletter, its structure and function, should change keeping in tune with the changed times. It is more so, especially, in this mobile digital age. While the structure, perforce, should assume a much more handy one (I don't mind if you replace 'handy' with 'mobile' ;-)), the function should cater to the requirements of both harbinger and acolyte, veteran and young, master and pupil alike."

And, we would like to provide as much trendy information as the chapter activities/forthcoming events, etc. It should be knowledge-enhancing, besides providing useful information related to our chapter."
